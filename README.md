# Cloak_Of_Invisibility
Cloak of Invisibility using openCV

As a Harry Potter enthusiast, I've long fantasized about wearing an invisibility cloak. It turns out that utilizing simple image processing techniques, 
I can now satisfy my childhood fantasy.

This project is done using simple computer Vision and its simple image processing tricks.
1. Choose a single-colored cloth, and if the cloth's color is red, make sure your background isn't red. Because if that color is present in the backdrop,
    it will cause issues.
    
2. We use red color cloth in this project, but you can use any color by changing the values for the visibilities of the color, which is simple to do.

3. We need to choose an IDE for our project and install the below mentioned libraries in order for it to work.
Open the terminal and put the following commands:
   a) OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
   b) NumPy: pip install numpy
